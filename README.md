# Rock-Paper-Scissors
Rock Paper Scissor Game using Html, CSS and Javascript.<br>
The design of this game is responsive and can be played on any device.<br> 
Main things I learned while doing it:<br>
a) Use of Media queries for responsive design<br>
b) Proper Writeup of html code and Proper Styling<br>
c) Imagination skills for designing the web app<br>
d) Ofcourse the logic part of Javascript, The best use of switch case<br>

### Highlights of the web app:
1) If you win, the result display will turn to green<br>
2) If you lose, the result display will turn to red<br>
3) If it's a tie, the result will be in gray color<br>
4) Live score Tracking and "RESET" option are given<br>
5) Gets the best user experience<br><br>

Note : I Made this game using my basic Knowledge in web development. Don't judge me based on my web app.<br>
Thankyou<br>
