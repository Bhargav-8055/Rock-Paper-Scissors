# Rock-Paper-Scissors
Rock Paper Scissor Game using Html, CSS and Javascript.
The design of this game is responsive and can be played on any device. 
Main things I learned while doing it:
a) Use of Media queries for responsive design
b) Proper Writeup of html code and Proper Styling
c) Imagination skills for designing the web app
d) Ofcourse the logic part of Javascript, The best use of switch case

### Highlights of the web app:
1) If you win, the result display will turn to green
2) If you lose, the result display will turn to red
3) If it's a tie, the result will be in gray color
4) Live score Tracking and "RESET" option are given
5) Gets the best user experience

Note : I Made this game using my basic Knowledge in web development. Don't judge me based on my web app.
Thankyou
